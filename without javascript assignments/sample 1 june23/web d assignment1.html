        <h3 id="t1" >Introduction</h3>
        <p>Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial turf, with a small, hard ball approximately 73 mm (2.9 in) in diameter. The game is popular among both men and women in many parts of the world,particularly in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina.</p>
        <P>
            The stick is made of wood, carbon fibre, fibreglass, or a combination of carbon fibre and fibreglass in different quantities. The stick has two sides; one rounded and one flat; only the flat face of the stick is allowed to progress the ball. During play, goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body.A player's hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick. If the ball is "played" with the rounded part of the stick (i.e. deliberately stopped or hit), it will result in a penalty (accidental touches are not an offence if they do not materially affect play). <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/fih-goalkeeper-of-the-year-2021-22-savita-punia-pr-sreejesh-india-hockey-team">Goalkeepers</a> often have a different design of stick; they also cannot play the ball with the round side of their stick.

        <h3 id="t2">A brief History</h3>
        <p>
            According to the <a href="https://www.fih.hockey/">International Hockey Federation (FIH)</a>, "the roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity".There are historical records which suggest early forms of hockey were played in Egypt and Persia c.2000 BC, and in Ethiopia c.1000 BC. Later evidence suggest that the ancient Greeks, Romans and Aztecs all played hockey-like games.[2] In Ancient Egypt, there is a depiction of two figures playing with sticks and ball in the Beni Hasan tomb of Khety, an administrator of Dynasty XI
        </p>
        <p>
            In Ancient Greece, there is a similar image dated c.510 BC, which may have been called keretizein because it was played with a horn and a ball.[4] Researchers disagree over how to interpret this image.It could have been a team or one-on-one activity (the depiction shows two active players, and other figures who may be team-mates awaiting a face-off, or non-players waiting for their turn at play). Billiards historians Stein and Rubino believe it was among the games ancestral to lawn-and-field games like hockey and ground billiards,and near-identical depictions appear in later European illuminated manuscripts and other works of the 14th through 17th centuries, showing contemporary courtly and clerical life.
        </p>
        <h3 id="t3">Field of play</h3>  
        <p>
            The pitch is a 91.4 m x 55 m (100.0 yd x 60.1 yd) rectangular field. At each end is a goal 2.14 m (7 ft) high and 3.66 m (12 ft) wide, as well as lines across the field 22.90 m (25 yd) from each end-line (generally referred to as the 23-metre lines or the 25-yard lines) and in the center of the field. A spot 0.15 m (6 in) in diameter, called the  penalty spot or stroke mark, is placed with its centre 6.40 m (7 yd) from the centre of each goal. The shooting circle is 15 m (16 yd) from the base line. </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.harrodsport.com/advice-and-guides/hockey-goal-field-dimensions">Field hockey goals</a> are made of two upright posts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar, with a net positioned to catch the ball when it passes through the goalposts. The goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape, and should be 2 in (51 mm) wide and 2 to 3 in (51 to 76 mm) deep. Field hockey goals also include sideboards and a backboard, which stand 50 cm (20 in) from the ground. The backboard runs the full 3.66 m (12.0 ft) width of the goal, while the sideboards are 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) deep. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="t4">The game</h3>
        <p>
            A match ordinarily consists of two periods of 35 minutes and a halftime interval of 5 minutes. Other periods             and interval may be agreed by both teams except as specified in Regulations for particular competitions. Since 2014, some international games have four 15-minute quarters with 2 minutes break between each quarter and 15 minutes break between quarter two and three.[citation needed] At the 2018 Commonwealth Games, held on the Gold Coast in Brisbane, the hockey games for both men and women had four 15-minute quarters.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December 2018, the FIH announced rule changes that would make 15-minute quarters universal from January 2019. England Hockey confirmed that while no changes would be made to the domestic game mid-season, the new  rules would be implemented at the start of the 2019-20 season. However, in July 2019 England Hockey announced that 17.5-minute quarters would only be implemented in elite domestic club games

        <h3 id="t5">International competitions</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest two field hockey tournaments are the Olympic Games tournament, and the Hockey World Cup, which is also held every four years. Apart from this, there is the Pro League held each year for the nine top-ranked teams. Field hockey has also been played at the <a href="https://www.commonwealthsport.com/">Commonwealth Games</a> since 1998. Of the men's teams, Pakistan has won the Hockey World Cup four times, more times than any other side. India has won the Hockey at the Summer Olympics eight times, including in six successive Olympiads. Of the female teams, the Netherlands has won the Hockey World cup the most times, with six titles. At the Olympics, Australia and the Netherlands have both won three Olympic tournaments.
